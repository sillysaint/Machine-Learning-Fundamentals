This trade-off is the most integral aspect of Machine Learning model training. As we discussed, Machine Learning models fulfill their purpose when they generalize well. Generalization is bound by the two undesirable outcomes — high bias and high variance. Detecting whether the model suffers from either one is the sole responsibility of the model developer."
